Feel like rather than a good team and a bad team it should just be like crazy on both sides now. Ksi smashed the planning and went beyond what they normally do. Not that he needs the ego boost but he smashed it, and was nice to see him in a video lol. As much as Harrys ideas miss the mark sometimes i think having him and ksi plan a trip would be good.

Hes also always the first one to stand up for others and support them. i could genially watch him all day just from the stramonium boost. also, the fact that Vik was put second meanest because he stands up for people is beyond wholesome. i know neither of them will see this but i hope they both know; they make my day and I'm sure thousands of others.",@sophiaedgley3304,2925

I get the point of 'come dine with me' is to cook the food yourself, so hats off to Harry- but in general I'd love a MW2 party.

I see a lot of comments coming for Simon and although I 100% agree he killed the vibe, he does acknowledge this himself during the scoring that if he'd perhaps joined in more it would have been different. 5/10 was one of the better scorings for Ethan and Josh's night, compared to JJ and Harry who gave them both a 2.

b8hpy-W5PiU,"I think they had the wrong strategy. Body takes time to process all the calories and store them as fat and it doesn’t happen very quickly. Instead, what they had to do was to consume things that improve water retention (salt should be one) and drink tons of water (and eating of course too but that is not the main focus). Couple hours before weigh in they would have to drink the most and try to not use the bathroom even if they really wanted to - hold it in. Day before the challenge they would have to do the opposite which is to drain body off water and essentially fast all day long. A bonus would be to reduce sweating during the day.",@RobVice,23

Everyone hides as normal
But its night time
The hiders all have night vision goggles
The seeker cannot use theses
The hiders can however the twist is that every time a sidemen is found, a light in the place/ house is switched on!
OR
Same thing but every 30 seconds or so the sidemen hiding have to move around / do a specific activity so that it's slightly easier for the seeker to find them ( since its all dark)
OR
A similar thing however everytime a sidemen is found a random sidemen goggles are switched off!!  Sounds epic but as always easier said than done

The only downside is that they never actually took “care” of the babies, since they didn’t have their microchip bracelets on to scan the baby, which then allows them to figure what it wants (unless I am blind and they do have them). 
So this means the baby only stopped crying due to its time period for the scenario running out.

24:39 When ""Tobi`s"" left hand decides it needs a slice of bread on his head
26:49 ""Tobi"" inventing a new fashion style: bread in a hat  #saveitforlater  and the reaction of the rest of the Sidemen

1:59:25 Hughwizzy makes the mistake of coming out of his goal during a goal kick, and Simon puts one over his head from deep, completing his hat trick, and increasing the Sidemen lead even further to 5-0.
2:04:17 ChrisMD cleans up after a Charlie Morley save, finessing JJ and Lachlan at the same time, and putting a strong ball into the bottom right. ChrisMD saves the YouTube Allstars from a shut-out, making it 5-1 Sidemen.
2:17:08 RiceGum makes a clean pass through to JJ, who then smashes it past Hughwizzy for his second goal of the game. It's a blow-out now, a 6-1 Sidemen lead midway through the second half.

Vikk introduced the concept ""Sidemen sundays"" and told they will try to do it for at least a month - they are still doing them and I dont think they have missed a single Sunday (mybe one)

JJ overconfident on beating Joe Weller - he did it just like he said

JJ for the first time mentioning the possibility to fight Logan and beating him - he did that

The idea of Ethan being married first - he is the only one single now

Castro is surprisingly good, he had some skills and his passing was so on point this game not to mention his attempts at goal were fantastic with the header being the only one that went in. Vikk's control was also surprisingly good and that shot on goal where the keeper collided with his defender was actually really accurate he has the right idea as the keeper was off his line but he took way too long.
